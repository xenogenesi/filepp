.SH C MACROS MODULE - cmacros.pm
The cmacros module causes the definition of the following predefined
macros to be quoted: \fBDATE, TIME, VERSION, BASE_FILE, FILE,\fP
(note: predefined macros are written as __MACRO__).

This makes the macros more "C" like, as the C preprocessor also puts
quotes around these macros.
