.SH GRAB MODULE - grab.pm
The grab module is used to grab input before processing. Its file name
is \fBgrab.pm\fP. 
.PP
The grab module is mainly for use in other modules, such as for.pm and
bigfunc.pm.  It grabs all input from a file before any processing is
done on it.  This allows other modules to do processing on the
original input data before the main processing is done.  For example,
the for module will store the original input inside a loop and re-use
it each time the loop is processed.
.TP
.BR #grab " \fImacro\fP \fIdefinition...\fP"
The grab module will start grabbing of all input from the grab
keyword, onwards.
.TP
.BR #endgrab
Ends a grab.  Everything between this keyword and the last
preceding \fB#grab\fP will be grabbed and stored for use in other
modules.
.PP
Grabs can be nested if required.
.PP
When calling grab from another module, use the following functions:
.TP
.BR Grab::StartGrab(\fI$startkeyword\fP, \fI$endkeyword\fP)
\fI$startkeyword\fP is the keyword that StartGrab is called from.
\fI$endkeyword\fP is the keyword that grabbing should stop at. 
.TP
.BR \fI@List\fP = Grab::GetInput()
Returns a Perl list containing all input grabbed from when grab was last
run.
.TP
.BR \fI$line\fP = Grab::GetInputLine()
Returns the line number of the input file where grabbing last started.
