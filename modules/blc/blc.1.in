.SH BLC MODULE - blc.pm
The Bracket Line Continuation module causes lines to be continued if
they have more open brackets: "(" than close brackets: ")" on a line.
The line will be continued until an equal number of open and close
brackets are found.

Brackets can be prevented from being counted for line continuation by
escaping them with a backslash: "\(" and "\)".  Any brackets found
with a preceding backslash will be ignored when deciding if line
continuation should be done and then have the backslash removed once
the full line has been found.
