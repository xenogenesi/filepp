.SH DEFPLUS MODULE - defplus.pm
The defplus module allows extra information to be appended to an
existing macro. Its file name is \fBdefplus.pm\fP.
.PP
The defplus module allows further things to be appended to existing
macros. The module implements one keyword:
.TP
.BR #defplus " \fImacro\fP \fIdefinition...\fP"
The \fB#defplus\fP keyword has the same syntax as \fB#define\fP, the
only difference being if the macro is already defined then
\fIdefinition\fP is appended to the existing definition of the macro.
If the macro is undefined then \fB#defplus\fP behaves in exactly the
same way as \fB#define\fP.
