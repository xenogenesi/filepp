Hash comments:

Normal line
# commented line
partly commented line, comment starts now: # this is a comment
# lots # of #comments
not a comment
# test of lines with "" in them
this is a # test
this is "another # test" # comment
this is "ano\"ther" # test
this "is" "another # test" # comment
this "is" "another" # test

This is a # comment
I like "lots of # comments"
