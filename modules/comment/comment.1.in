.SH C/C++ COMMENT MODULE - c-comment.pm
The c-comment module removes all C style:

\fI/* comment */\fP

and C++ style:

\fI// comment\fP

comments from a file.  C and C++ comments are removed after keywords
have been processed.  If you wish to remove C and C++ comments before
keywords are processed, define the macro \fBREMOVE_C_COMMENTS_FIRST\fP
before loading the module, eg:

\fBfilepp -DREMOVE_C_COMMENTS_FIRST -m c-comment.pm\fP

.SH HASH COMMENT MODULE - hash-comment.pm
The hash-comment module removes all comments of the style:

\fI# comment\fP

from a file.  This is the commenting style used by Perl, Bourne Shell,
C Shell and many other programs and configuration files.  Hash
comments are removed after keywords have been processed.  If you wish
to remove hash comments before keywords are processed, define the
macro \fBREMOVE_HASH_COMMENTS_FIRST\fP before loading the module
(Note: if you do this and also use # as the keyword character then the
keywords will be removed BEFORE they are processed).
