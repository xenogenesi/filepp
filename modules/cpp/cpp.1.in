.SH C MACROS MODULE - cpp.pm
The cpp makes filepp behave in a similar manner to a C preprocessor CPP1.

DISCLAIMER: filepp is not meant to be a drop in replacement for a C
preprocessor even with this module.  I would not recommend using
filepp as a C preprocessor unless you fully understand how it differs
from a real C preprocessor.  The output from filepp with the cpp
module will not be the same as a real C preprocessor.
