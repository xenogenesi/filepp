	filepp - A generic file pre-processor

See the file INSTALL for installation instructions.

The following examples of how filepp can be used are included with
this ditribution:

test.html - HTML document:
	to build: make test
	output:   test.html
	input:    test.html.in footer.html.in header.html.in

testsuite - Testsuite, included in test.html.  If all tests passed should
	return no output (except for 3 warnings about macro 'ARTHUR'
	which should be printed to stderr).

testmod.pm - A very simple Filepp module.

filepp.1 - Man page:
	to build: make man
	output: filepp.1
	input:  filepp.1.in

filepp.lsm - Linux Software Map (LSM) entry:
	to build: make lsm
	output: filepp.lsm
	input:  filepp.lsm.in


The Makefile is used to build these files, it includes example rules
which can be used to convert from a filepp input file to the output
file.

Filepp also supports modules which can be used to modify and extend
the core functionality.  All modules included with this release can be
found in the "modules" directory.
